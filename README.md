# HelloBar_Automation

We are using Selenium, TestNG for Reporting and Java as a language to automate, all of these resources are open source.

TestNG is better choice over JUnit, for complete comparison please visit : http://www.mkyong.com/unittest/junit-4-vs-testng-comparison/

We will use combination of "Page Object Model" and "Data Driven" automation frameworks to automate Hello Bar.

This is the Package Representation of our Automation Framework:
PageObjects : This package will contain classes representing each page which need to be automated
Helpers : This package will contain all the Helper classes which can be used throughout the automation project
Tests : This package will contain all the test scripts(test cases) which we need to automate in different classes.
